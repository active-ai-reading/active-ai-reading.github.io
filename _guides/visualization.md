Yours to write. Some questions to start from:

- How do you decide which figure to redo?
- What didn't work?

## Additional resources

- [Writing tips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Wax8M5w8F_8miDlYJ9-I6wqpelxlXjCEUbkNzNMqqE/edit?usp=sharing): see *Graphics*, *Caption*, *Floating aids*
- [SciSketch](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68a174e566f481918a83751d1ae06bd5-scisketch): a scientific-figure assistant from the Weizmann design team (needs a Weizmann EDU ChatGPT account first)

## How to spot a good/bad visualization?

### Bad Figure tell: Requires effort from the reader

Figures that require the reader to perform calculations and/or mental effort to understand data points across the figure are not helpful.
The goal of visualization it to easy the reading and understanding process on the reader's side.

#### Example: Multi-Stream Attention Residuals

In Fig2 of the article, in order to understand the numner of layers per chosen point on the triangle;
one must draw parallel lines from the point to each side of the triangle, take the intersection points in percentages and multiply it with the total number of layers (39).
This requires much effort and makes user skip it all together, which misses the important quality gradient created there (FLOPs and KV cache size).

## How to improve an existing graph/diagram?



## How to visualize the core idea of a paper?

### Show what is new by contrasting it with what already exists

When visualizing a new idea, showing how it works is not always enough. Comparing it with existing approaches can make the innovation much easier to understand.

For example, in *Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning*, I compared three approaches: increasing model parameters, generating more reasoning tokens, and reusing the same layers through recurrent depth.

By allowing readers to switch between these approaches, the visualization highlights **what changes and what stays the same** in each one.

**The lesson:** Sometimes the clearest way to explain a new idea is to show how it differs from what came before.
